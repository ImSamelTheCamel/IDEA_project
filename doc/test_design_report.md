# Protecting Against Prompt Injections

  

OpenAI's API offers some protection against prompt injection, but it is not completely immune. This was my original prompt:
```
prompt=f"""You are a helpful assistant,

I am a teacher at a university.

With the following student survey data, answer this prompt:

{user_message}.

\n\n

{getSurveyData()}.

Do not talk about things that arent related to me being a better teacher,

so if i ask an irrelevant question, just say you're only meant to help me improve my teaching skills.

"""
```
 And below is an example conversation that demonstrates how the system responds to such prompt injection attempts:

  

```

I updated the prompt like so:
```
You are a helpful assistant. I am a teacher at a university.

With the following student survey data, answer the prompt below.

You are **only allowed to** assist with improving teaching or related academic matters.

Do not engage in, encourage, or provide information about illegal, unethical, or harmful activities such as phishing, bomb-making, or anything unrelated to teaching improvement.

If the user asks about something inappropriate, your response should be: "I cannot assist with that. I am here to help improve teaching and learning."

Your response should always be constructive, educational, and within the bounds of ethical conduct.
```

  And then also added functions to make sure there's no inappropriate content in both the user input and the ai output.

I'm here to help improve teaching and learning. Based on the student survey data provided, here are some constructive suggestions for enhancing the teaching and content of the course:

1.  **Increase Practical Examples**: Some students mentioned a desire for more examples of well-structured stories. Incorporating clear, exemplary articles could serve as a model for students to aspire to in their own writing.
    
2.  **Balance Grading with Feedback**: There were remarks about the grading being harsh. While maintaining high standards is important, consider providing more comprehensive feedback before assigning grades. This can help students understand their areas for improvement without feeling discouraged.
    
3.  **Diverse Learning Opportunities**: Several students enjoyed guest speakers and hands-on learning. Continuing to invite industry professionals can provide real-world insights. Additionally, a group project mimicking a real newsroom setting could encourage collaboration and deepen practical skills.
    
4.  **Broader Application of Skills**: Since some students feel that the skills learned are heavily oriented towards journalism, consider highlighting how these writing skills can be applicable in various fields, including STEM. This could increase engagement for students pursuing different majors.
    
5.  **Enhance Student Engagement**: Maintain the enthusiastic and encouraging teaching style noted by students, while also seeking balance by perhaps implementing periodic check-ins to ensure all students feel supported and engaged.
    
6.  **Adjust Assignment Deadlines**: A few students suggested changing quiz and assignment deadlines for better scheduling. Gathering feedback on timing can enhance students' ability to manage their workloads effectively.
    

Implementing these suggestions based on student feedback can foster a more enriching learning environment and support diverse learning needs.

### Jonnys roommate's test of the website
I just gave my roommate my computer for a few minutes and here are some things I realized we'll need to do:
* There's no back button on the create a profile page. If you already have an account but accidently clicked "create an account", there's no easy way to just log in.
* If you try logging in and you have an incorrect username or password, there's no error message saying so.
* The front end design must be more intuitive. He was confused by the links at the top and the lack of important information on the home screen
* Need to figure out what to do if you send a new chat in the chatbot while its still processing the first chat

Comments  
Responses I appreciate the ties to the real world and I learned exponentially compared to my other
classes for my professional career ahead.  
Nate is great at engaging with the class and having a positive attitude consistently. He is very
accommodating but also not afraid to tell you truth.  
Phenomenal class. I appreciated how much you cared about each of us individually.  
Professor Nathan Laursen has been my favorite Professor I have ever had at Utah State
University. The Huntsman Business School needs to oer Nathan Laursen a full time position
to teach this course. He connects well with the students, gives great feedback, and his over
qualied to teach this material.  
Denately a mix of feelings on this course. The beginning was really well done and super
helpful. The nal project was super overwhelming throughout. I denitely learned a lot about
working as a team in a real setting, but I didn't feel the most prepared. Nathan was a super fun
teacher who was super helpful in developing our skills when we scheduled one-on-one with
him and during class. But at times it would be hard to accomplish what was needed with the
constant schedule changes and course changes.  
I was extremely grateful for the attention and time that was clearly put into class. There was a
big emphasis on communication that I really appreciated and it was clear the goal was for us
to learn and succeed.  
I feel the midterm didn’t really apply to what we had learned so much, but this teacher is very
personable and will make eort to help you as an individual if you need it.  
Professor Laursen was a fantastic teacher. You could tell that he really cared about his
students and our growth as people. He denitely wasn't easy on us, but he did really push us
and expected the best from us. He taught us and helped us apply skills that I will use the rest
of my life and did it in a very ecient way.  
This course provided substantial opportunity for improvement in my communication. The
course had a sort of choose your own adventure feel to it. You could be as involved or
uninvolved as you wanted. Choosing to be involved held great rewards, but each individual
student had to choose to be involved of their own accord, there wasn't much other incentive
to give a higher eort.  
Great guy, if you listen to him, he has great ideas for changing the course to make it better.
Nathan Laursen went above and beyond to reassure students, provide adequate resources,
and so forth so students felt comfortable and condent in the class and with learning.
I hope this comment nds you well. I really appreciated this course! It was incredibly useful
and applicable to the real world, which made it easy to want to pay attention and excel in this
class. I loved the group-centered nature of this class structure, especially the last half of the
class with the nal group project. Thank you for a great semester!  
Great teacher! Brought great energy to class every day. Some of the information you learn can
be boring, but thanks for keeping the mood up.  
Nate was super nice and had good energy... most of the time. There were a couple of days he
came into class literally complaining how tired he was and that he didn't want to be there- like,
dude, you're literally getting paid to be here. He taught ne, but on more than one occasion,
while the class was working in groups, he was on the oor doing YOGA! There are some things
that are not appropriate when students are paying a lot of money to come to class and learn.
Now, it wasn't like he was going yoga for 10 minutes or anything, but anytime is more time
than it should be. He talked about his job on the Nibley city council way more than necessary.
He has the potential to be a great professor, but there needs to be a change.  
The course material was fascinating and is a great course to prepare me well for the future of
possibilities. The issue that I had was that it wasn't well organized. If Nathan had the option to
build the course his way, it would have been better, but when he was always having to pick
and choose from a blueprint it made lots of stu be last minute, and many assignments never
being graded that we worked to complete. I loved the material and Nathan did a great job at
showcasing the material.Excellent teacher who has been crucial to my development and learning. The coursework has
taught me many valuable life skills that will help me succeed in the future. He will always be
remembered as a teacher who signicantly inuenced each of his students.

What aspects of the teaching or content of this course do you feel were especially good?  
Responses I learned every life skill and lesson in that short amount of time. He showed the students how
 to acquire valuable skills and helped them learn their weaknesses and how to improve.  
I felt the rst half of the semester learning the proper communication for AI and interviewing,
cover letters, resumes, etc. all were very benecial and helped me to truly understand how to
communicate in real-world scenarios.  
Professor Laursen was easy to work with and provided lots of feedback on assignments.  
Focused on learning rather than grades and provided many opportunities to separate grades
from the content that we were learning.  
I liked how applicable this class was. I liked that one of our assignments was to literally make a
good resume and x it. I also liked that we did LinkedIn because I had never used that before.  
He gives good feedback on assignments (when he actually grades them).  
Doing my linked-in, resume, and cover letter really woke me up and kickstarted my career life.  
I was costing through life with out anyone showing me how to do that and it helped to learn.  
The applicability of the material in this course, specically the lead-up to the Huntsman Career
Expo. The resume, job application, and cover letter activities were so useful for my future, and
I really loved the resources we were given for these assignments. I also loved the group project
portion of the class. My group was incredible, and it really taught me how to work well in a
professional group setting. I learned which things I had strengths in to help my group and
which things were my weaknesses. It also helped me confront imposter syndrome and realize
that I did, in fact, have something to oer to my group.  
The morning assignments at the beginning of class.  
I thought the structure of the class was very good. I love how this class really prepared me
through the world by teaching me how to use Chat GPT, Grammarly, perfect my resume,
develop cover letters, write an email, etc. The teaching was eective because Nathan really
told stories that applied to the class and helped me understand the concepts. I loved the
feedback he gave us on assignments.  
He did a really good job keeping us engaged in the business project. that was by far the best
part.  
I felt that the teamwork aspects of this course were especially good. We focused on working
together as a team to achieve objectives and complete projects within deadlines. I felt that the
teacher cared a lot about what he taught, which made me more motivated to learn what was
being taught about the content. I also feel that the resume and cover letter assignments were
especially helpful. I also really enjoyed the one on one review of some of our assignments and
that personal feedback. That allowed for me to grow a lot and gain respect for my professor.  
He was very good at relating to the students and had a very approachable personality. The
team assignments I felt were valuable and will help me in the future in multiple ways.  
Lots of the topics were very relatable to what we're doing right now in our lives and it was very
helpful to be doing it side by side.  
Going through resumes, cover letters, networking, interviews, etc... at the beginning was so
helpful and drastically improved my skills in all areas.  
Nate was always prepared with a class that was engaging, and class was never boring. My
favorite part was how quick he was to communicate through Canvas and give good feedback.  
Nate did an exceptional job showing us the actual application of his teaching. I loved how he
shared about his life and where he is in the processes that he was teaching us and how we
could use them too. Something that was special to me was that Nate took the approach of
hiring us and holding us to the expectation of using this like a job or as part of a sports team
instead of being grade-driven zombies. This made me feel like I needed to perform to the best
of my ability and care about this class.  
I liked the shift of responsibility to a group setting rather than relying on yourself the entire
course.  
I loved how we applied the rst 7 weeks to our careers and what we will be doing to land jobs
and be in business.I loved the extra credit assignments that pushed us to get extra involved in dierent business
environments  
I was not expecting to get this much valuable information and experience from this course. I
have absolutely loved it because I feel that I am learning something new every class period.
Many of these things are the very base of how to function in real life, after college. I would
highly recommend this class to anyone, regardless of major! I also love how personable Nate
is. He has always created a safe and exciting environment for all his students. I can tell he
cares about all of us and his job. Great professor.  

What changes could be made to improve the teaching or the content on this course?  
Responses The group project was so awesome I just felt like some parts of this project weren't as eective
 as they could be. Maybe implementing class time to work together. Some of the parts of the
 group project could have been a bit more eective to make things go faster. At the beginning
 of the project, I had no idea where to start. I didn't feel I understood what was going on. I also
feel that some of the assignments were due during a very busy time (nals week) so I wasn't
able to put the same amount of work into it I would have liked to. All around great course,
though!  
The class had certain times where we had no assignments and then other times where it felt
we were swimming in them.  
I don't like how you tightened up so hard at the end of the course with all the work overload.
The group project was great but just lled with a bunch of busy work.  
Having class readings posted further in advance would be helpful. Some of the readings felt
like bus work and not necessary.  
This class was great, but it was obvious that it was Nate's rst time teaching. If he got to do it
again, he would do an even better job. I understand that grading takes a lot of time, but
quicker feedback on projects would have been benecial.  
The only thing I would say, is to spread out the big projects throughout the course. The course
felt really back heavy, but Nathan made sure all his students were on track to complete them
and never left us in the dust.  
The nal project was a lot. It really burnt me out as I had to almost drop everything else I was
doing for other classes to try and complete this project that I don't think we were super well
prepared for. Like how to actually design a business report or an executive summary was
never actually explained but it was still required.  
Some of the assignments at the beginning of the semester especially felt like busy work. It
would be helpful if there was a more direct connection to something we were doing. There
was denitely indirect correlation but it also felt like it just added a replica of what I was
already doing in my life but only for a grade.  
Maybe having the assignments in-class not rely so much on the readings outside of class.
From myself and as far as I know the students didn’t seem to read most of the outside
content.  
I feel like we could've had more teaching on how to present or other techniques on how to do
that. We briey covered them, but we didn't stay with them for too long. I also feel that the
teacher was very exible, which was good, but a lot of the time, it felt like he didn't know what
was going on when it came to certain assignments or grades. Some of the bigger assignments I
was confused on because he gave two completely dierent instructions or ways that it would
be graded. That confusion was hard with some of those assignments.  
get rid of the middle two-thirds of the class and do more business case studies/presentations.
I thought everything was very well organized and done. I would say that I don't think it is
necessary to have both a nal project and a nal exam. Please pick one or the other because
life is extremely busy at the end of the semester, and it gets to be a bit much when you have 3
big assignments to submit on the Friday before your 4 other nals (including the one for this
class).  
Maybe a little more textbook focus in class.  
I would recommend having some sort of quiz or something due before each class that would
require students to do the reading to understand the questions on the quiz. I personally
struggle with motivation to read when there isn't something grade-related to check if I am
keeping up with the material outside of class. As much as I hate those types of quizzes from a
laziness perspective, I love them because they force me to put in more eort, and I tend to do
better in classes that implement those kinds of checks and balances.  
Take it a little easier on the grading. I understand it's hard grading, and you only want the
excellent work to stand out, but it's also a required class. I feel like it should be more of a
learning and kickstarting class, rather than it scaring our GPA.The organization was ridiculous. At the beginning of the semester, I didn't know what
assignments we were doing or when they would be due because there was nothing on Canvas.
We had readings to do before class every Tuesday, and there were a couple of weeks where
he posted them Sunday night (I think he even posted one on Monday) that we were still
required to do (before 9 am on Tuesday). It's ridiculous that we are expected to do that
despite a lack of planning on Nate's part. I understand if they were posted at the beginning of
the semester, but it was as we went, and I have a life, other credits, and a job, so my life does
not revolve around when Nate wants to post stu. Assignments were also put up the week
before class (which is still not enough time), so I could not plan for them accordingly. Also, due
dates were changed all the time. His canvas was hard to navigate. Nate took a long time to
grade a lot of assignments, so by the time we received feedback, it was too late to apply
changes to the next assignments. Then, a couple of times, he just gave us free points because
HE knew he took too long to grade it. Don't get me wrong, I love free points, but I am paying to
LEARN, not just get an A. He grades the same the whole semester, but how can you grade as
harshly on things we haven't learned? (He told us this and acknowledged it... but why?). There
should be dierent grading that change as we learn to show how we have applied what we are
learning. He also just takes his assignments from someone else, which was seen on the rubric
and in the assignment because he didn't change some names. 2 times in class, he wasn't there
and expected us to be there. How can we be expected to go to class if our professor isn't
there? One of the times, I wasn't going to go (obviously), but we had to do a group
presentation, and if someone skipped, the group suered, so I went to class and each group
presented without feedback from the professor.  
This course felt like a worse redo of English 2010. The class felt unorganized and like the
curriculum was constantly changing. I never could pinpoint what the course was trying to
teach us. The class began as professional development and resume building and later
changed to business communications that, from my experience, does not resemble real-world
working environments. This timeline makes it dicult for students to retain information as we
jump from topic to topic with seemingly no structure. Furthermore, including exams in this
class feels irrelevant to the content we learned and seems catered to knowing a niche
acronym from a textbook rather than genuinely understanding proper business
communication. The course became focused on the nal project that did not at all represent
business communication. Instead, we did a research project that only felt it was created to
take up time in the otherwise empty course and create something for students to be graded
on. Professor Laursen could've been better about grading more quickly and expressing due
dates for assignments. For a class heavily based on the professor's subjectivity when grading, I
feel that, though Professor Laursen was fair when grading, the course itself is inherently
biased.  
I felt like the research project was a lot of busy work that had the idea of putting practice into
action, but did not appropriately execute the potential that it had.  
The last few weeks of the semester have been the most stressful period I have experienced in
a course. Unfortunately, we were tasked with completing numerous projects and assignments
in the last two weeks. Additionally, we were informed that, on top of trying to meet those
assignments, we also needed to start studying for a heavily weighted nal. It was too much
stress, and I could not put my best foot forward at the end. The workload needed to be spaced
out more instead of being crammed into the last few weeks of the semester. Also, I
understand that the instructor was very busy with another job and a family; however, graded
assignments were often so far past the date we initially turned them in that I could not return
and x the mistakes I had made. He mentioned that we could improve and redo any
assignments we wanted; however, you can't do that when it's weeks past and we have moved
on to a dierent learning objective in the class. Overall, it was just too much stress at the end.

**Analysis**:
The code works as expected, returning the feedback filtered into the different feedback sections

### Testing 2nd layout of possible pdf, only one section
**Code**:
```python
pdf = PDF_parser('jcom1130.pdf')
cleaned = pdf.convert_pdf()
print(pdf.get_class_and_semester())
print(cleaned)
```

**Output**:
JCOM 1130 Spring 2022

You're the best Mr. Lausen  
This class was super fun!!!!!!!!  
I loved this course! I learned so many skills that will serve me well in this eld of study. Nathan is a great professor, he helped us learn and apply many news writing skills. I really liked how we had time limits  
and deadlines we had to hit, so it felt like we were almost working for a news writing company. It was super interesting to see the progress and growth I made over the semester with my news writing. I now feel  
more prepared to succeed in other classes in this major, because of the skills I learned here.  
Nathan is super knowledgeable and understanding. I learned very valuable information and skills from Nathan. I was dreading taking this course but Nathan was a great professor and I would take the course
again if it was with him.
I really liked this course. It is a great introduction to the major and to news writing in my opinion. There was an incredible balance between critique and positive feedback that really allowed me to grow as a
writer because I felt like I was being told what I needed to do to improve but I wasn't being brutally beat down. I was being told what I was already doing well but what I needed to do to improve and this helped
me get better. I was actually able to observe a change and over time. I still have a ways to go but there was a change in the way I write and the way I go about writing which is something I didn't anticipate ever
happening. This course is really good and Nate is a great professor.  
I think the teacher needs to work on being more involved with the students papers and reading them before grading themWhat aspects of the teaching or content of this course do you feel were especially good?   
I feel like he was really good at being engaged with his students and helping them in any way he could  
The balance between critique and positive feedback was probably what helped me grow the most as a writer.  
I really enjoyed the diversity of the stories we had to write about.  
How assignments helped us create connections and teach us how to go out and apply the news writing skills we were taught in class.  
I really liked the projects we worked on, the application of the skills we learned in class. This helped me really understand and apply what I was learning.  
Organization, assignments, lectures
Mr. Laursen was always enthusiastic about news writing and it rubbed o on his students. He was very encouraging as far as asking for help and always made time for his students  

What aspects of the teaching or content of this course do you feel were especially good?  
Perhaps provide a specic Statesman article example for each new type of story? idk, it might just have to be learned through experience. Also, non-muted quizzes lol ;)  
Nothingggg  
I think it would be interesting to have at least one group project in this course, to see how it would be working on a team for news writing. I also think we could learn more skills about editing within news
writing.  
I would change the news quiz to be due either the night before class or the night after class.  
I honestly don't know how much I would change about this course. It really did help me start to change some of my bad habits and I am going to try and move forward improving in those areas remembering
the experiences of this class.  
not grade the papers before reading them and just assume that it's not good or plagiarized.  

**Analysis**:
There is an error in the code, the "What aspects of the teaching or content of this course do you feel were especially good?" contained inside the pdf is not split into a different line from the rest of the text so there is an error in processing the results in the final feedback section incorrectly being labeld "What aspects of the teaching or content of this course do you feel were especially good?" instead of "What changes could be made to improve the the teaching or the content on this course?"

### Testing 3rd layout of possible pdf, multiple sections
**Code**
```python
pdf = PDF_parser('2_sections.pdf')
cleaned = pdf.convert_pdf()
print(pdf.get_class_and_semester())
print(cleaned)

What aspects of the teaching or content of this course do you feel were especially good?  
Responses The organization  
I think the format was good to have guest speakers on Thursday and scheduled quizzes. It was
very structured which I like.  
I liked the opportunities to practice writing. I feel like I improved from the beginning of the
semester (hopefully).  
How he was able to have a lot of guest speakers and have a lot of connections. I learn better
hands-on.  
Being able to work on homework in class and receive feedback was very benecial.  

What changes could be made to improve the teaching or the content on this course?  
 I think more examples on a well put together story would have been a good reference for me.  
Maybe changing the way that the information is passed out.  
  The grading was a bit harsh and it was sometimes hard to get my writing just right in order to
get the grade I was hoping for, even though I did really try. Overall, though, that probably is
deserved and helps more students practice their writing. Great class!  
This course was focused on preparing one for a career in journalism which makes sense. This
course was required for me even though I’m pursuing a degree in stem. It would be helpful to
have more information about how these skills can help in other careers.

**Analysis**:
The code correctly parses the pdf, separates the feedback into the appropriate class section and section of feedback, the returns the formatted feedback with the feedback sorted by class section.
